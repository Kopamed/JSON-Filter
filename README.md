# JSON-Filter


### The code's purpose

This code contains two functions - `extract_tour()` and `extract_wishlist()`. They both take in 1 argument: `txt`. The argument should be a object/json file and in the **format of a string**. Even if the text does not have "{" and at the start and "}" at the end, it will automatically add them. The functions return a dictionary.


### How to use the code
`git clone https://github.com/Kopamed/JSON-Filter/`, then move jfilter.py to the direcotry where you are going to use these functions. Then add to the top of your code add `from jfilter import *`. Now you are able to call these functions from anywhere in your code!
